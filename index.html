  <div><h2>The Civic Project ensures uncomplicated access to all public services, utilities, elections, and forums for citizens of St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin.</h2> </div>
            <div><h3>About the Project</h3>
            <p>The Civic Project was created out of a need to update rural communities' digital infrastructure to ensure that public services, data, and opportunities are accessible to everyone. Public services and information are hard to find and inaccessible. This is especially true in rural communities that lack overall resources. St. Croix Falls, WI has a population of 2,000.
The goal of this project is to successfully redesign the cityâ€™s current website based on community input and feedback throughout the design process. 
The Civic Project concept and design is the creation of Haley Prochnow and is the capstone project for her Masters of Graphic and Web Design degree from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design.</p>

                <h3>Resident-Driven Design</h3>
                <p>The residents of St. Croix Falls, WI, are the life force of this project. Twenty plus citizens participated in an early needs analysis survey, informational interviews, and user testing of the Election Information process. Their input and feedback drove the design process throughout each phase of the project. 
Overall, residents expressed they wanted more transparency involving their local government and better access to opportunities within the community. 85% of residents surveyed said they would be more likely to participate in city events, elections, programming if they had better access to city information.
